        #            WARNING: BREAKING CHANGES IN UPCOMING VERSION `v1.0.0`            #
        #                                                                              #

        # This formula currently provides two methods for managing PHP; the old method #
        # under `php` and the new method under `php.ng`. In upcoming `v1.0.0`, the old #
        # method will be removed and `php.ng` will be promoted to `php` in its place.  #
        #                                                                              #
        # If you are not in a position to migrate, you will need to pin your repo to   #
        # the final release tag before `v1.0.0`, which is expected to be `v0.38.1`.    #
        #                                                                              #
        # If you are currently using `php.ng`, there is nothing to do until `v1.0.0`   #
        # is released.                                                                 #

        # To migrate from the old `php`, the first step is to convert to `php.ng`,     #
        # before `v1.0.0` is released.                                                 #
